    - Groups content visually. 
    - Has optional action buttons. Drop 1 or 2 buttons within `c-card__actions`. Use one button to have one primary action (e.g. confirm). Add another button below the first one (in the markup) to also have a secondary action (e.g. cancel).
    - Add modifier `c-card--content-centered` to have all elements within `c-card__content` horizontally and vertically centered.
